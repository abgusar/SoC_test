SO THAT : I can ensure that high-priority rules (e.g. legal restrictions) always take precedence, even if other permissions are more permissive.

I KNOW THIS IS SUCCESSFUL WHEN : I can assign different priorities to permission rules (e.g. Critical, High, Medium, Low). A “legally restricted” file cannot be opened by a User even if they have general ""View"" access to that file type.. The system provides clear feedback when lower-priority permissions are overridden."
Internal Users can automate permission changes;"AS A : Data Administrator for the States of Guernsey

I NEED TO : set time-based or condition-based rules to automatically change user permissions

SO THAT : I can ensure access is granted or revoked without manual intervention

Internal Users can control access using dynamic authentication rules;"AS A : Security Officer for States of Guernsey

I NEED TO : authenticate Users using dynamic factors (e.g. time, location, etc.) that challenges unusual access requests

SO THAT : I can protect sensitive systems and data from unauthorised access.  

I KNOW THIS IS SUCCESSFUL WHEN : The system blocks or requires additional verification for logins outside of a User's typical access patterns (location, time, device). The level of security adapts to the sensitivity of the data being accessed."
Internal Users can apply risk-based access controls;"AS A : System Administrator for the States of Guernsey

I NEED TO : assign sensitivity levels to data and services, and require matching authentication strength for access

SO THAT : access to sensitive data is restricted to Users who have provided sufficient proof of identity
