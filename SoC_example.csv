SO THAT : I can protect sensitive systems and data from unauthorised access.  

I KNOW THIS IS SUCCESSFUL WHEN : The system blocks or requires additional verification for logins outside of a User's typical access patterns (location, time, device). The level of security adapts to the sensitivity of the data being accessed."
